# 📦 Using Smithbox to Export Text and Param Data for *Elden Ring: Nightreign*

This guide explains how to use **Smithbox** (via Wine on Linux) to export two data files that can then be parsed by your `parse.py` script into the format used by `relic-ids.json`.

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- **Smithbox** (Windows executable)  
- If on Linux, **Wine** installed on your system  
- A copy of *Elden Ring: Nightreign* installed (via Steam or otherwise)  
- `parse.py` from the same directory as this README.

---

## 🚀 Step 1 — Launch Smithbox

Run Smithbox directly if on windows or if on Linux, using wine:

```bash
wine Smithbox.exe
```

---

## 🪶 Step 2 — Create a New Project

1. In the menubar, select **Project → New Project**  
2. Fill in the fields:
   - **Name:** whatever you want, e.g. `Nightreign`
   - **Project Type:** `Elden Ring: Nightreign`
   - **Project Directory:** choose any location (e.g. `Z:\home\USERNAME\smithbox`)
   - **Data Directory:**  
     `Z:\home\USERNAME\.local\share\Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN\Game`
3. Click **Create**

---

## 📜 Step 3 — Export Item Text Data

1. From the menubar, open **Text Editor**
2. In the **left pane**, navigate to:  
   `English (US) → Item`
3. From the menubar, select:  
   **Data → Export → File → Export Selected File**
4. When prompted:
   - Enter a filename **without an extension**, e.g. `strings`
5. Smithbox will write the file to:

   ```
   [project directory]/.smithbox/Workflow/Exported Text/strings.json
   ```

---

## ⚙️ Step 4 — Export EquipParamAntique Data

1. From the menubar, open **Param Editor**
2. In the search box at the top of the left pane, type:
   ```
   EquipParamAntique
   ```
3. Click the result to open it and ensure you can see its values in the **Rows** pane.
4. From the menubar, select:  
   **Data → Export CSV → All Rows → Export to File… → Export All Fields**
5. Save the file wherever you like, using a clear name such as:

   ```
   antique.csv
   ```

---

## 🐍 Step 5 — Parse the Exported Data

After you have both files (`strings.json` and `antique.csv`), place them in
your CWD and run the parsing script:

```bash
./parse.py
```

This will process the exported data and generate output in the format used by `relic-ids.json`.

---

## ✅ Summary of Output Locations

| File | Source | Default Export Path |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| `strings.json` | Text Editor export | `<project>/.smithbox/Workflow/Exported Text/strings.json` |
| `antique.csv`  | Param Editor export | user-chosen (e.g. `~/smithbox/antique.csv`) |

---

### 📝 Notes

- Both exported files must come from the same game version to ensure data consistency.  
- Paths like `Z:\home\USERNAME\…` correspond to your Linux filesystem through Wine’s drive mapping.  
- If generating due to a Nightreign update, re-export both files before re-running the parser.
